# AltAuto

Automatically create and suggest alternative text for images referenced in Markdown files.

## Alt Text and Markdown

The [Markdown standard][md] allows alternate text to be specified using syntax like:

```md
![The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!](/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg "San Juan Mountains")
```

Which will render into HTML as:

```html
<img src="/assets/images/san-juan-mountains.jpg" title="San Juan Mountains" alt="The San Juan Mountains are beautiful!">
```

That's a good example of the mechanics of including alt text but misses the mark on being a good clue for accessibility (it's not really explaining what's in the picture). With the help of AI, here are some better options:

* A scenic landscape featuring snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky, with a foreground of rolling hills covered in golden foliage and a rustic wooden fence.
* Snow-capped mountains rise above a field of yellow flowers with a wooden fence in the foreground. The sky is clear and blue.
* A scenic landscape featuring snow-capped mountains in the background, a clear blue sky, and a wooden fence in the foreground with lush greenery and yellow flowers.

There are many good resources on alt text, but this is a good simple one: [WebAIM: Alternative Text][aim].

## The Plan

The plan is to build this as a demo of what's possible but also be a useable example that could be adopted for Markdown sites such as blogs, websites or documentation.

Components:
* Script or library which uses an AI model to analyze an image and suggest alt text
  * Research and experimenting on a good model + prompt that works well
  * Make it easy to change the model and prompt
* Script to read all Markdown .md files in the project, find any image references without alt text, and run the generator script to add it
* GitHub action to run the above automatically and, if any changes made, create a pull request to bring in the alt text additions

## Prompts to Test

https://dri.es/comparing-local-llms-for-alt-text-generation

1. You are a helpful alt-text generator assisting visually impaired users. Generate a clear and concise caption (15-30 words) that highlights the most important subject and action. Focus only on essential details, avoiding unnecessary background elements. Use simple, everyday language and avoid overly descriptive or poetic words.
2. Whatâ€™s in this image? Be brief, it's for image alt description on a social network. Don't write in the first person.
3. You write alt text for any image pasted in by the user. Alt text is always presented on a single line so it can be used easily in Markdown images. All text on the image (for screenshots etc) must be exactly included. A short note describing the nature of the image itself should go first.

## LLM Commands

```
llm "describe this image" -a images/CoachCathy.png
```

Next: try with ollama local models

## TODO

How to not recreate alt text for existing PRs not merged yet.

Caching LLM results per image to avoid repeated requests?

To start, limit to just a couple images.
